## Description
- HosteLite is a system which manages data of students, staff, students' representative, admission process, mess and also helps in maintaining exit-entry records of students who stay in the hostel, visitors and couriers delivered to them.

- It also allows students to complaint to the admin directly and get the query resolved.

- All the announcements related to the hostel can be found by all types of users on their dashboards itself.

- This system is designed in favour of the hostel management which helps them to carry out all the above mentioned manual tasks without even being present there.

- It does not require the person handling the system to be very efficient or to be good at calculations. It greatly eases the work of efficiently managing the hostel.
